# front-end-starter-template-gulp

This project can serve as a "playground" template project. 

By "playground", I mean sometimes we just want to test out some functions or write a quick demo, 
there is no need to get a bunch of preprocessing tools,like `minification`, `concatenation` or `wiredep`, involved in the "gulping".

Basic tools included in this project:
* jshint
* sass
* watch
* connect

By running `gulp`, you should see the app running with "live reload" functionality. No need to install any "live-reload" extension.

Note: If you don't use sass, writing css directly is totally fine.
